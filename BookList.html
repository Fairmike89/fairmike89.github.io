                <p>Ever since I was around the age of 14 reading has always been my favorite pass times. Weither it's diving into a new book and discovering new adventures. Or revisiting an old book and reliving those favorite adventures. Most books I read are in the area of Science Fiction and Fantasy, epic fantasys are amonge my favorite(think <i>Lord of the Rings</i> type books). It's these big epic fantasy series that end up making me re-read books. There is always something you might missed in the first read through, that when you read it again a secound or third time that you finally see the big picture. Little moments or clues you over looked that end up coming to life. Now a days I don't have a lot of time to sit down and read phyical books but at work I'm mostly alone and my job is mostly stocking so I am constantly listening to audiobooks.</p>

                <h2 class="header2">Harry Potter</h2>
                <p>As a Millennial book nerd it kind of goes without saying that I am a big <i>Harry Potter</i> fan. For me <i>Harry Potter</i> is where I started out with reading. Before starting these books in 8th grade I was at a very low reading level, a couple years behind were I was suppose to be, so I really struggled with reading. In 5th grade we read the first book in an after school book club becasue parents didn't want it read during out loud reading time, so my teacher did an after school read aloud instead. I loved it so much that for christmas my mom got me the first 4 book(which was all that was out at the time). I never could get through them though, so me and my sister got the tapes from the library and listen to them. About half way through book 4 we had to return them because they were overdue. I was so in grossed in it that I grab the 4th book off my shelf and desided I was going to finish it myself. From then on I was hooked! I couldn't stop reading, my reading level jumped in one semester from being a couple years behind to be a couple years a head of my year. Which is why this series will always be special to me because without it I wouldn't be the reader I am today.</p>

                <h2 class="header2">Brandon Sanderson</h2>
                <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn" target="_blank"><i>Mistborn Series</i></a> is a new one for me(image on the left). At the  suggestion of my boyfirend(who is more of a book nerd then me) I started listening to this trilogy on audible while at work when we first started dating. It is an epic fantasy series that has one of the best hard magic systems in it. It is an amazing story about the fate of the world, who has the power to change it and  apocalypse size chaos. For mor detail one it please see the link above. Brandon Sanderson is one of my newest favorite authors(though hes been at it for 20+ years). He is a fantastic story teller and his worlds just capture you. Right now I'm in the first few chapters of his 4th book in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive" target="_blank">The Stormlight Archive</a> series. His books are very detail oriented and extreamly well writen. Brandon Sanderson's newest revail is that he jsut revaild that he, in secret, wrote five books in the last 2 years. Four of those books are full novels and the fifth is problaby going to be turned into a grafic novel. This has been a major shock to authors and fans since generaly it takes authors a year or more to just finish one book, with some authors taking several years! He is a talented author and a staple of the fantisy book community.</p>
