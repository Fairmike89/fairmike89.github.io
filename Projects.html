                <p>Since this is only my first semester back in school since previously graduating from Columbia college back in 2017, and these past few weeks have been my first experience with programing I don't have a lot of Projects to show. However, I do want to share one of my first projects I did for my intro. to programing calss. This was the first bit of programing that felt real to me and showed be what you can do with the power of coding. This is an assingment that calculates how much paint and at what cost to paint a cylinder if you know the hight and radius.</p>
