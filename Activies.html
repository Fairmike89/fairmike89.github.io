                <p>I really enljoy being outdoors and traveling, especially with family and friends. I really love to go hicking in the summer though <a href="https://mostateparks.com/park/rock-bridge-memorial-state-park" target="_blank">Rock Bridge State Park</a>, sometimes with my sisters dog along. Back when I was a kid I use to love to ride our horses thoug the fields and even went to Eminence, MO at the end of summer one year for their annual <a href="https://crosscountrytrailrides.com" target="_blank">Country Trial Ride</a>. It's this hung week long camping trip at the end of summer were we do trail rides, floating, and a bunch of other stuff. Which leads me to one of my favort activities!</p>

                <h2 class="header2">Camping</h2>
                <p>Just imagine, a warm summer night gathered around the camp fire with friends, fireflys ancing around and the sound of nature. That is how I truly relax and recharge, not with big vacations at some crowded destination(though I do love those too!), but with a simple, quite weekend get a way to <a href="https://www.sandspringresort.com" target="_blank">Springs Resort</a> in Lebanon, MO. Now when it comes to camping I am very old school, well for the most part. The only real "glam" is that we use air mattresses. Other then that it's very old school camping, tents by the river, cooking over the open fire, no running water or electricity(except for small portable phone batteries to keep phones charged to play music), ect. Camping is just one of the reasons to head down and pitch a tent next to the river, the other reason is to go floating. Your firends and you just lazily going down the river while having some drinks is the best way to relax, and with the camp grouns providing a ride back in a rickety old school bus you can party and have all the fun you want. Then promptly crash when you get back to the campsite for a couple hours, get up have food and enjoy the warm summer night.</p>

                <h2 class="header2">Wine Trails</h2>
                <p>The <a href="https://hermannwinetrail.com" target="_blank">Hermann Wine Trail</a> is something me and my boyfriend love to do whenever we get the chance. The photo here to the left is <a href="https://www.hermannhof.com" target="_blank">Hermannhof Winery</a> in Hermann, MO. This is one of our favorite winerys to visit when we go to Hermann, they have this really cool underground celler that dates back to 1852 were they have a little tasting area were you can see some of the historic wine casks. Now the full extent of the celler isn't available to the public, but you can see a great deal of it. There are several different wine trails though out the year and all are a bit different though they go through the same winerys. The main difference is the food they pair with the wines. Each even has a common theme of what each winery pairs with their wines. The last one we went on in December of 2021 was the "Say cheese wine trail" where each winery paired their wine with a cheese realted dish.</p>
